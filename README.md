###Project 1 : NUMBER GUESSING GAME 
## Description
This project is a mind-reading number guessing game.
The user is asked to think of a number between 0 and 100 without revealing it. The program then attempts to guess the number by repeatedly asking whether the number is equal to or greater than a calculated middle value.
The program narrows down the range after each hint provided by the user. It continues this process until the correct number is found.
This is achieved using Binary Search logic, making the program efficient and accurate.
