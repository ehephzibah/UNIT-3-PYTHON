### Project 1 : NUMBER GUESSING GAME 
## Description
This project is a mind-reading number guessing game.
The user is asked to think of a number between 0 and 100 without revealing it. The program then attempts to guess the number by repeatedly asking whether the number is equal to or greater than a calculated middle value.
The program narrows down the range after each hint provided by the user. It continues this process until the correct number is found.
This is achieved using Binary Search logic, making the program efficient and accurate.
### Project 2: PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER
## Description
This project checks whether a password entered by the user is Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
The program evaluates the password based on the following conditions:
•	Minimum length requirement
•	Presence of uppercase letters
•	Presence of lowercase letters
•	Presence of numeric digits
•	Presence of special characters
Each satisfied condition increases the strength score. Based on the total score, the program categorizes the password accordingly and displays the result to the user.
This helps users understand the importance of creating strong and secure passwords.
